# useUploadOnMountEffect
Provides any component the ability to upload a file when it mounts

> This hook is useful for situations where you want to create a component that displays the contents of a file like `name`, `fileSize`, etc. But want to upload that file when the component mounts. Use this hook to enrich your component and do all of the heavy lifting for you!


```js
  import { useUploadOnMountEffect } from "@rtkwlf/ui";

  const MyFileComponent = ({ file }) => {

    const onFileUploaded = React.useCallback((itemKey, response) => {
      console.log(itemKey, response);
    }, []);

    const {
      percentUploaded,
      error
    } = useUploadOnMountEffect({
      file,
      uploadUrl: "/my-upload-endpoint"
      itemKey: "1",
      onFileUploaded,
      headers: [
        {
          header: "Authorization",
          value: "Bearer <my-token>"
        }
      ]
    });

    return (
      <div>
        <p>{file.name}<p>
      <div>
    );
  };
```
