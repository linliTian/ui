# Theming
### Provide a theme to change the look and feel of each component

## Creating a Theme

If you wish to create your own theme use the provided `createTheme` function. Each component provides its own theme
 that can be overridden. Please see the respective component documentation for a full list of the available theme
  overrides.

```
import { createTheme } from '@rtkwlf/ui';

const myTheme = createTheme(colorOverrides, themeOverrides);
```

## Using a Theme

Once you have created a new theme you can provide it to the components via the `ThemeProvider`.

```
import {
  createTheme,
  ThemeProvider as UIThemeProvider
} from '@rtkwlf/ui';

const myTheme = createTheme({
  primary: 'red'
}, {});

const App = () => (
  <UIThemeProvider theme={myTheme}>
    <Button>My Red Button</Button>
  </UIThemeProvider
)
```
